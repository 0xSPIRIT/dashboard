# Chapter 11 - Mutating Data

We have server components where you do 'use server',
and the function runs on the server. These components
can only be used as POST requests, like when sending
form data.

---

There's this thing called zod which is a library that
handles data validation. You just define an object
with the syntax, like so...

import { z } from 'zod';

  const FormSchema = z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    customerId: z.string(),
    amount: z.coerce.number(),
    status: z.enum(['pending', 'paid']),
    date: z.string(),
  });

  const CreateInvoice = FormSchema.omit({ id: true, date: true }); // this is the schema for an invoice

... and when you're ready to validate, you do
  const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
    customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
    amount: formData.get('amount'),
    status: formData.get('status'),
  });
