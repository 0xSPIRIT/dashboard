# Chapter 7 - Fetching Data

*Request waterfalls*
  This is a sequence of network requests that depend on the completion of previous
  requests. For eg. I query the database for a user ID, then I use that result as
  input into another network request.

  Sometimes it's better to do them all at once, in parallel, improving efficiency.

*Parallel data fetching*
  Use await Promise.all(...) to initiate all promises at once.
