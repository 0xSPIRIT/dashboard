# Chapter 3

Next.js automatically optimizes the fonts in the application when you use next/font.
This helps so when the user visits your application there's no additional network requests
bogging down the system before rendering can complete. It statically hosts the fonts.

*Importing fonts*
  Create a fonts.ts file and export all your fonts as variables when you declare them:
      import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
      import { Lusitana } from 'next/font/google';
      
      export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
      export const lusitana = Lusitana({ subsets: ['latin'], weight: ['400'] });
  
  To use them you simply add ${inter.className} to the class of any tag that you want to
  apply the font to.

  Also you can add cool stuff like this
       import { GlobeAltIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';

*Images*
  The reason we don't just do <img src="..."/> is so we can let next.js
  ensure the image is responsive on different screen sizes, specify image
  sizes for different devices, prevent weird layout issues, and lazy load
  images that are outside the user's viewport.

  You can use the 'next/image' component to automatically optimize these.

    - Prevent layout shift automatically when images are loading
    - Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a small viewport
    - Lazy loading images by default as they enter the viewport
    - Serving images in modern formats like WebP or AVIF if the browser supports it.

  The image width and height attributes in the <Image /> component are not the
  size of the image that is rendered like in HTML <img/> but rather the size
  of the actual image file to determine the aspect ratio.
