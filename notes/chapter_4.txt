# Chapter 4

The app router converts file paths from the app/ directory into URL paths.
Each subfolder, (eg. app/dashboard/) can have a page.tsx which is a special
Next.js file that exports a React component & is required to route that page.

Note that app/page.tsx is the home page that is associated with the '/' route.

The layout.tsx file is one that allows you to share layout between multiple
pages. For instance, in dashboard/layout.tsx, every sub-route will have that
layout. Likewise, the default /layout.tsx is applied to everything in your
application.
