# Chapter 5

We can use <Link/> instead of <a/> to go between pages in our application so
we can utilize client-side navigation, rather than having to reload the entire
page when we click on an <a> tag.

Next.js also prefetches the content of each linked routes for the user,
rendering it in the background for the user.
